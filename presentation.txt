Hive De-duplication (Quick overview)

Hive to SOLR (quick - detailed later in the week)

Discussion re: SOLR

*** We are using SOLR as a fairly simple tool. Its depth and complexity is fairly daunting, but it is extremely powerful. We need to discuss what the implications are, and how it can be used. We are not using many or any of these functionalities - although we have explored them for use in the banana code base and have found them wanting.

  - Implications of schema less
  - Practical implications of schema
    - FIELD DESIGN -  use of copy fields ( https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Documents%2C+Fields%2C+and+Schema+Design / )
    - SEARCHING - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Searching
    - SUGGESTER https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Suggester
    - Implication of Faceting (complexity threshold) - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Faceting
    - Letting SOLR do stats - why we don't believe it is simple or easy - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Stats+Component
    - Non plain text content - implication of indexing and basic data ops : https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Indexing+and+Basic+Data+Operations
